This page contains instructions for installing !SfePy onto Windows using [http://www.pythonxy.com python(x,y)]. We will also use [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit msysgit] to install the UMFPACK scikit to speed performance. You will probably need a few gigabytes of free disk space due to the installed size of python(x,y) and msysgit. This procedure was tested for Windows XP 32-bit machines. It should work in theory for any Windows machine supported by python(x,y) and msysgit, but your milage may vary.


= Steps to installing !SfePy onto Windows using python(x,y) =
  # Download and install current release of python(x,y) from the _Downloads_ tab at http://www.pythonxy.com/
    * Version at time of writing is 2.6.5.1
    * Detailed installation notes
      # Double click on the python(x,y) installation file
      # Click _Okay_ at warning if not installing with an administrator account
      # Click _I Agree_ at license notification window
      # In the _Python_ subtree of the _Choose components_ window, additionally select the following packages:
        # ETS
        # !SymPy
      # You can optionally select the following packages:
        # Sphinx - needed to rebuild the documentation
        # winpdb - a graphical python debugger - useful for solving problems with !SfePy runs
      # You can optionally choose whether or not to install Eclipse - it is not needed by !SfePy
      # In the _Other_ subtree of the _Choose components_ window, additionally select SWIG
      # Choose an installation directory
        * Probably C:\pythonxy is good unless you have a reason to change it
      # It will take a few minutes to install python(x,y)
  # Download and install msysgit from _Downloads_ tab at http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
    * Version at time of writing is 1.7.0.2
    * Make sure to get the file that begins with "msysGit-fullinstall"
    * Detailed installation notes
      # Double click on the file beginning with "msysGit-fullinstall" to start the installation process
      # Choose an installation directory
        * Probably the default, C:\msysgit, is best unless you have a reason to change it
      # After clicking ok, the msysgit files will be extracted and then a terminal window will open showing git being compiled
  # Open an msys terminal (or use the one that opens after installing msysgit)
    * The msys terminal is opened with C:\msysgit\msys.bat
  # Decide where to put !SfePy and UMFPACK scikit sources
    * Probably C:\src is good
    * In msys, this path would be /c/src
  # Create the source directory
    * In the msys window, type the following commands:
      # mkdir /c/src
      # cd /c/src
  # Download the UMFPACK scikit source code
    * For this task, we will use the svn support built in to git
    * In the msys window, type the following commands:
      # git svn clone http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scikits/trunk/umfpack umfpack-scikit
