<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=Installation=
== Requirements ==

Installation prerequisites:
  * recent numpy, scipy (with umfpack wrapper, or umfpack scikit), swig

Dependencies:
  * matplotlib, pyparsing, umfpack, pytables
  * schroedinger.py requires pysparse, gmsh (2D) , tetgen (3D)
  * log.py (live plotting) requires multiprocessing, matplotlib with GTKAgg
  * isfepy requires ipython
  * postproc.py requires mayavi2

For example in Debian:
  $ apt-get install python-tables python-pyparsing python-matplotlib python-scipy

!SfePy is known to work on various flavours of Linux, and on Intel Macs. Not
tested on Windows.

!SfePy should work both with bleeding edge (SVN) and last released versions of its dependencies, see INSTALL file in the tarball. Submit an issue, please, in case this does not hold.

== Generic installation instruction ==

 # Download the [http://code.google.com/p/sfepy/downloads/list latest source release] or the development version from our git repository [http://git.sympy.org/?p=sfepy.git], see the [http://code.google.com/p/sfepy/wiki/Downloads?tm=2 Downloads] tab.
 # Look at site_cfg_template.py and follow the instructions therein.
 # (Optionally) edit the Makefile: compiler, swig command, ...
 # 'make'

See also INSTALL and RELEASE_NOTES files in the tarball.

If all went well, proceed with [BasicTasks running tests and examples].

== Check the Sfepy installation ==

After installing sfepy you can chek if all the functionlities are working by running the automated test. From the source dir type:

{{{
./runTests.py
}}}

If some test fails, please run it in debug mode:

{{{
./runTests.py --debug test/failing_test_name.py
}}}

and report the output to the `sfepy-devel` mailing list.

== Miscellaneous notes ==


* using umpfpack on fedora 8 (contributed by David Huard)

  entry in numpy site.cfg:

{{{
  [umfpack]
  library_dirs=/usr/lib64
  include_dirs = /usr/include/suitesparse
}}}

  Comment by david.huard,  Mar 26, 2008:

  Of course, suitesparse and suitesparse-devel must be installed.


* Intel Mac (thanks to Dominique Orban for his advice):

  To build !SfePy on an Intel Mac the following options need to be set in site_cfg.py:

  opt_flags = '-g -O2 -fPIC -DPIC -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic'
  link_flags = '-dynamiclib -undefined dynamic_lookup -fPIC -DPIC'

  (revision http://hg.sympy.org/sfepy/rev/609196c918be is needed)

=Installation on Ubuntu (tested on Jaunty Jackalope 9.04)=
==Prerequisites==

Firstly you have to install the dependencies packages:
{{{
sudo aptitude install python-scipy python-matplotlib python-tables python-pyparsing libsuitesparse-dev 
}}}

Then download and install the `umfpack scikit`s in some local dir. In the following example it will be installed in `$HOME/local`:

{{{
svn checkout http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scikits/trunk/umfpack
cd umfpack
python setup.py --prefix=${HOME}/local
}}}

Add to your `.bashrc` the line:

{{{
export PYTHONPATH="${HOME}/local"
}}}

then re-open a terminal and if the scikits was installed correctly importing `scikits.umfpack` in python should give no error:

{{{
$ python
>>> import scikits.umfpack
>>> 
}}}

==Installing Sfepy==

Now download the latest *sfepy* tarball release (or the latest development version from [http://git.sympy.org/?p=sfepy.git;a=snapshot;h=HEAD;sf=tgz this link]).

Uncompress the archive and enter the sfepy dir, then type

{{{
make
}}}

after a few minutes the compilation finishes.

Finally you can test sfepy with:

{{{
./runTests.py
}}}

If some test fails see [#Check_the_Sfepy_installation Check the Sfepy installation] section for further details.
