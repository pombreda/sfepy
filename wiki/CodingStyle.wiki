#summary Coding style used in SfePy.

All the code in !SfePy should try to adhere to python style guidelines, see
[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/].

Following the discussion in the issue 43 there are some additional recommendations:

 * prefer whole words to abbreviations in public APIs - there is completion after all:
  * yes: equation, transform_variables(), filename
  * rather not: eq, transvar(), fname
 * functions have usually form {{{<action>_<subject>()}}}
  * e.g.: save_data(), transform_variables(), do not use data_save(), variable_transform() etc.
 * variables like V, c, A, b, x should be tolerated only locally when expressing mathematical ideas

Really minor recommendations:

 * avoid single letter names, if you can
  * not even for loop variables - use e.g. ir, ic, ... instead of i, j for rows and columns
  * not even in generators, as they "leak" (this is fixed in Python 3.x)

These are recommendations only, we will not refuse code just on the ground that it uses slightly different formatting, as long as it follows the PEP.

*Note*: some old parts of the code might not follow the PEP, yet. We fix them progressively as we update the code.
