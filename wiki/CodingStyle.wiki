#summary Coding style used in SfePy.


All the code in !SfePy should try to adhere to python style guidelines, see
[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/].

This is *new in the development* version , see [http://hg.sympy.org/sfepy http://hg.sympy.org/sfepy].

Following the discussion [http://code.google.com/p/sfepy/issues/detail?id=43 at http://code.google.com/p/sfepy/issues/detail?id=43] there are some additional recommendations:

 * prefer whole words to abbreviations in public APIs - there is completion after all:
  * yes: equation, transform_variables(), filename
  * rather not: eq, transvar(), fname
 * functions have usually form {{{<action>_<subject>()}}}
  * e.g.: save_data(), transform_variables(), do not use data_save(), variable_transform() etc.
 * variables like V, c, A, b, x should be tolerated only locally when expressing mathematical ideas
 * abc = 1 instead of abc=1 except keyword arguments

Robert has also these additional recommendations:

 * do not to use single letter names
  * if you can, not even for loop variables - use e.g. ir, ic, ... instead of i, j for rows and columns
 * {{{function( arg1, arg2, arg3=value )}}} than {{{function(arg1, arg2, arg3=value)}}}, as IMHO the extra spaces make the text more readable (ok even without syntax highlighting).

Ond≈ôej likes this:

 * you can use single letter names in loops, why not
 * write functions as f(x, y, z, word=True)
