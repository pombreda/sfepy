Simple finite elements in Python.

This is a site for !SfePy developers and users.

=== News ===
 * *06.08.2010* Version 2010.3 released (significantly rewritten code for better interactive use, cleaner and simpler high level interface, new examples, tests, simplified but more powerful homogenization engine, many bugfixes), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2010.3_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2010.3_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *10.05.2010* Version 2010.2 released (significantly updated documentation, new mesh readers, conversion formulas for elastic constants, basic tensor transformations, stress tensor conversion, new examples, tests, many new terms and bugfixes), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2010.2_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2010.2_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *01.03.2010* Version 2010.1 released (new sphinx-based documentation, refactoring of base functions (polynomial spaces) and element geometry description, interpolation between different meshes, terms for describing perfusion and active fibres in the total Lagrangian formulation (applicable, for example, to active muscle tissue models) new tests, many new terms and bugfixes), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2010.1_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2010.1_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *24.11.2009* Version 2009.4 released (greatly improved postprocessing and visualization capabilities, unified handling of user-defined functions, new tests, terms, many bugfixes), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2009.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2009.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *21.07.2009* Version 2009.3 released (_Windows installation_, updated postproc.py - visualization, new tests, terms, solvers, bugfixes), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2009.3_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2009.3_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

=== Key Features ===

 * solving many problems described by PDEs:
  * linear problems: linear elasticity, Poisson equation, Stokes, Darcy flow, Biot problem
  * nonlinear problems:
   * Navier-Stokes equations
   * finite deformations: hyperelastic neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin materials in the total Lagrangian formulation
 * other PDEs containing the implemented terms, both 2D and 3D
 * problems in complex domain (e.g. acoustics)
 * fading memory terms
 * particular applications (see the [http://sfepy.kme.zcu.cz/ Projects page])
  * acoustic band gaps in phononic materials (similar to forbidden frequency ranges in photonic crystals, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal)
  * Schroedinger equation
  * homogenization of porous media (modelling of muscle tissue, bones, engineering porous materials)
