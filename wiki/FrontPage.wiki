Simple finite elements in Python.

This is a site for !SfePy (http://sfepy.kme.zcu.cz) developers.

=== News ===

 * *02.03.2009* Version 2009.1 released (new solvers, new mesh readers, unified homogenization framework, dispersion analysis, phase velocity computation for phononic materials and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2009.1_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2009.1_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *04.12.2008* Version 2008.4 released (framework for running parametric studies, greatly improved support for time-dependent problems, live plotting using multiprocessing module, type of term arguments determined fully at run-time, new terms and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2008.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2008.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt] Version numbering was changed to a "year.release" scheme. Also the http://sfepy.kme.zcu.cz site was substantially updated.

 * *02.09.2008* Version 00.50.00 released (finite strain elasticity: total Lagrangian (TL) formulation, solving problems in complex numbers, generalized equations to allow linear combination of terms, run-time type of state term arguments, refactoring to follow Python coding style guidelines and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/005000_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 005000_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *01.07.2008* Version 00.46.02 released (alternative short syntax for specifying essential boundary conditions, variables and regions, manufactured solutions tests using !SymPy and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/004602_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 004602_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *26.03.2008* Version 00.41.03 released (works on 64 bits, support for various mesh formats, new solvers and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/004103_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 004103_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

=== Key Features ===

 * 2D/3D linear elasticity, Poisson equation, Stokes, simple Navier-Stokes problems, Darcy flow and other problems with PDEs containing the implemented terms
 * fading memory terms
 * acoustic band gaps in phononic materials (similar to forbidden frequency ranges in photonic crystals, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal)
 * Schroedinger equation
 * problems in complex domain (e.g. acoustics)
 * finite deformations: hyperelastic neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin materials in the total Lagrangian formulation
