=== News ===

 * *05.12.2011* Version 2011.4 released (cython used instead of swig to interface C code, many terms unified thanks to new optional material term argument type, updated Lagrangian formulation for large deformations, automatic generation of gallery of examples, etc.), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2011.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2011.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *10.08.2011* Version 2011.3 released (major update of terms aiming at easier usage and definition while retaining original C functions, overriding problem description items on command line, improved developer guide, Primer tutorial - a step-by-step walk-through of the process to solve a simple mechanics problem, etc.), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2011.3_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2011.3_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *31.05.2011* Version 2011.2 released (experimental implementation of terms aiming at easier usage and definition of new terms, Mooney-Rivlin membrane term, update build system to use exclusively setup.py, allow switching boundary conditions on/off depending on time, support for variable time step solvers, etc.), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2011.2_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2011.2_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *24.03.2011* Version 2011.1 released (discontinuous approximations, user-defined material nonlinearities, improved surface approximations, speed-up mesh reading, extensive clean-up - less code, many bugfixes and many more updates), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2011.1_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2011.1_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *06.12.2010* Version 2010.4 released (higher order elements, refactoring of geometries (reference mappings), transparent DOF vector synchronization with variables, interface variables defined on a surface region, many bugfixes and many more updates), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2010.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt  2010.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

=== Key Features ===

 * solving many problems described by PDEs:
  * linear problems: linear elasticity, Poisson equation, Stokes, Darcy flow, Biot problem
  * nonlinear problems:
   * Navier-Stokes equations
   * finite deformations: hyperelastic neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin materials in the total Lagrangian formulation
 * other PDEs containing the implemented terms, both 2D and 3D
 * problems in complex domain (e.g. acoustics)
 * fading memory terms
 * particular applications (see http://sfepy.org)
  * acoustic band gaps in phononic materials (similar to forbidden frequency ranges in photonic crystals, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal)
  * Schroedinger equation
  * homogenization of porous media (modelling of muscle tissue, bones, engineering porous materials)
