Simple finite elements in Python.

This is a site for !SfePy (http://sfepy.kme.zcu.cz) developers.

=== News ===
 
 * *21.07.2009* Version 2009.3 released (_Windows installation_, updated postproc.py - visualization, new tests, terms, solvers, bugfixes), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2009.3_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2009.3_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *12.05.2009* Version 2009.2 released (new top level scripts (_isfepy_ - customized IPython shell, _postproc.py_ - mayavi2 based result viewer, _probe.py_), automatic html documentation generation via doxygen, new solvers, new mesh readers, extended syntax of equations for boundary traces of variables, short syntax for almost all input elements and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2009.2_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2009.2_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *02.03.2009* Version 2009.1 released (new solvers, new mesh readers, unified homogenization framework, dispersion analysis, phase velocity computation for phononic materials and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2009.1_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2009.1_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *04.12.2008* Version 2008.4 released (framework for running parametric studies, greatly improved support for time-dependent problems, live plotting using multiprocessing module, type of term arguments determined fully at run-time, new terms and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/2008.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 2008.4_RELEASE_NOTES.txt] Version numbering was changed to a "year.release" scheme. Also the http://sfepy.kme.zcu.cz site was substantially updated.

 * *02.09.2008* Version 00.50.00 released (finite strain elasticity: total Lagrangian (TL) formulation, solving problems in complex numbers, generalized equations to allow linear combination of terms, run-time type of state term arguments, refactoring to follow Python coding style guidelines and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/005000_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 005000_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *01.07.2008* Version 00.46.02 released (alternative short syntax for specifying essential boundary conditions, variables and regions, manufactured solutions tests using !SymPy and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/004602_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 004602_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

 * *26.03.2008* Version 00.41.03 released (works on 64 bits, support for various mesh formats, new solvers and other improvements), see [http://sfepy.googlecode.com/svn/web/releases/004103_RELEASE_NOTES.txt 004103_RELEASE_NOTES.txt]

=== Key Features ===

 * solving many problems described by PDEs:
  * linear problems: linear elasticity, Poisson equation, Stokes, Darcy flow, Biot problem
  * nonlinear problems:
   * Navier-Stokes equations
   * finite deformations: hyperelastic neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin materials in the total Lagrangian formulation
 * other PDEs containing the implemented terms, both 2D and 3D
 * problems in complex domain (e.g. acoustics)
 * fading memory terms
 * particular applications (see the [http://sfepy.kme.zcu.cz/ Projects page])
  * acoustic band gaps in phononic materials (similar to forbidden frequency ranges in photonic crystals, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal)
  * Schroedinger equation
  * homogenization of porous media (modelling of muscle tissue, bones, engineering porous materials)
